# Building a Better Doungeon Master :game_die:
Building a better dm is a dungeons and dragons 5th edition API. While dnd beyond and other dnd API's exist this one will be more complete and have data from all expanded tomes. Don't tell Hasrbo. 

## Description
Right now there is no front end, tho I will be building routes and controllers to test how easy taht data will be to parse with fetch etc. The hope is to be able to implment this database for a future dm tool to design encounters and keep track of abilites without paying habro an absurd amount of money. I love givin gmy money to dnd but right now I can buy the books but not use their content online unless I buy the books again. Until then I find it easier to copy everythign down into a mongodb schema.

## Getting Started
gotta script to seed got a script to start the server all good.

## Things to come
